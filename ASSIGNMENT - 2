Question - 1: What do you mean by structures?
/* A structure in C is a user-defined data type that allows you to store different types of data together under one name.
It is used when you want to group related data items — like name, age, and marks of a student. */

// CODE

#include <stdio.h>

struct Student {
    int roll;
    char name[30];
    float marks;
};

int main() {
    struct Student s1 = {1, "Jitin", 87.5};

    printf("Roll: %d\n", s1.roll);
    printf("Name: %s\n", s1.name);
    printf("Marks: %.2f\n", s1.marks);

    return 0;
}
// output

Roll: 1
Name: Jitin
Marks: 99.50

/* Question-2 : What do you mean by Array & Pointer Array?

Array: A collection of same type of elements stored in continuous memory locations.
 Example: int arr[5]; (stores 5 integers)

Array of Pointers: An array where each element is a pointer (it stores addresses).
 Example: int *ptr[5]; (stores 5 addresses of integers)  */

//CODE

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int a = 10, b = 20, c = 30;
    int *ptr[3];  // array of pointers

    ptr[0] = &a;
    ptr[1] = &b;
    ptr[2] = &c;

    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
        printf("Value of ptr[%d] = %d\n", i, *ptr[i]);
    }

    return 0;
}

//OUTPUT

Value of ptr[0] = 10
Value of ptr[1] = 20
Value of ptr[2] = 30

/* Question-3: Compare two structures variables by using the comparison operator ( Not equal & equal) ?

C does not directly allow comparing structures with == or != operators.
We must compare each member individually. */

//CODE

#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

struct Student {
    int roll;
    char name[20];
};

int main() {
    struct Student s1 = {1, "Jitin"};
    struct Student s2 = {2, "RAHUL"};

    if (s1.roll == s2.roll && strcmp(s1.name, s2.name) == 0)
        printf("Structures are Equal\n");
    else
        printf("Structures are Not Equal\n");

    return 0;
}

//OUTPUT

Structures are Not Equal

/* Question-4: Perform an arithmetic operations on structures. explain simple theory and coding example

We cannot do arithmetic directly on entire structures,
but we can perform arithmetic on their members. */

//CODE

#include <stdio.h>

struct Numbers {
    int a;
    int b;
};

int main() {
    struct Numbers n1 = {10, 5};
    struct Numbers result;

    result.a = n1.a + n1.b;
    result.b = n1.a * n1.b;

    printf("Addition = %d\n", result.a);
    printf("Product = %d\n", result.b);

    return 0;
}

//OUTPUT

Addition = 15
Product = 50
